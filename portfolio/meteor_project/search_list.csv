CM,"Chondrites: CM class: This group mostly belong to petrologic type 2, though some belong to type 1. They contain less water than CI chondrites, and show less aqueous alteration, which leads to better preservation. Contain many complex organic compounds, with one found in Australia 1969, containing 230+ amino acids. They also had interesting isotopic signatures, leading to the suggestion of their origin being outside of our solar system."
CR,Chondrites: CR class:
CV,"Chondrites: CV class: Most of this group belong to petrologic type 3, with only 1 being from type 2, and one belonging to type 4. More than 5% of CV chondrites is made up from high-temperature calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs). The CAIs of a CV meteorite named, Allende, contained microscopic diamonds. These diamonds are older than the Earth and Sun. This group is divided further into 3 subgroups: CV3R, CV3OxA, and CV3OxB."
CO,"Chondrites: CO class: All meteorites of this group belong to petrologic type 3. The CO group have a similar chemistry and composition to the CV group, though they formed under different conditions. More black in appearance, and have much smaller chondrules, with these chondrules making up about 70% of the entire meteorite."
CI,"Chondrites: CI class: Represent some of the oldest, friable, and ""ugly"" meteorites. Suggested origin is from comets known as ""dirty snowballs"", which are composed of a mixture of frozen water and pristine matter. They belong to the petrologic type 1. Type 1 means that the meteorite suffered a lot of aqueous alteration, resulting in their lack of any relict chondrules. Due to the amounts of organic matter like amino acids and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), these meteorites provide clues to the origin of life on Earth."
