Welcome to my website github!

The portfolio folder, houses my final project for BIOLOGY 3100 Data Analysis for Biologists. In this project I am exploring a NASA data-set of found meteorites from the years 860-2013. 

The data-set was downloaded from [insert Kaggle link]. Note that there was a comment made for the data-set, the csv upon download has an type error; the meteorite, Northwest Africa 7701, should have a year value of 2010, not 2101, this is corrected for in the analysis and visualizations of this data.

So far, I have been building a Shiny app that displays all meteorite data onto a Leaflet map. Filtering features are still being built, and meteor class descriptions are still being written.
