This is my final project for BIOLOGY 3100 Data Analysis for Biologists. In this project I am exploring a NASA dataset of found meteorites from the year 860-2013. 

The dataset was downloaded from [insert Kaggle link]. Note that there was a comment made for the dataset, the csv upon download has an type error; the meteorite, Northwest Africa 7701, should have a year value of 2010, not 2101, this is corrected for in the analysis and visualizations of this data.
